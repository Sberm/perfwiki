If you want to check the MkDocs UI as a webpage in this workspace,
You only need to do it once at the beginning: `pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin`.

Do `mkdocs serve`, Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```sh
$ virtualenv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
# You only need to do it once at the beginning:
#   pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-git-revision-date-localized-plugin
$ mkdocs serve
...
 Watching paths for changes: 'docs', 'mkdocs.yml'
 Serving on http://127.0.0.1:8000/

# Automated deployment from markdown

If the markdown results are pushed to `origin/main`, [Github CI](.github/workflow/ci.yml) will automatically run and deploy to the `gh-deploy` branch.
If manual updates to the [perfwiki.github.io](https://perfwiki.github.io/) are needed, you can run `mkdocs gh-deploy` directly to deploy it.
